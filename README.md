## Course

This is a bonus course. It explores the Object Oriented Programming of Python.

The course has 6 lessons, each with a number, 1 through 6. In the end, the student has to hand in an assignment.

The course is published on the internet by the teacher and can be found on his website [wiztech.nl](http://wiztech.nl/#inleiding_python).

The desired endresult is a game that uses Python Turtle. In the game, two cars race against eachother. The full assignment can be found at the [website](http://wiztech.nl/module_inleiding_programmeren_in_python/les_7_object_modellering/overig_lesmateriaal/eindopdracht/eindopdracht.pdf).
